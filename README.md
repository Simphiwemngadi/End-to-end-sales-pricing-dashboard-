# Sales Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **interactive Sales Dashboard** to analyze business performance and extract meaningful insights from sales data. The dashboard provides both high-level KPIs and detailed breakdowns of **revenue, profit, margin, quantity sold, customers, products, regions, and time trends**.

The project demonstrates practical use of **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** for data preparation and **Power BI** for data visualization and analytics.
